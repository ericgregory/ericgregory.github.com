So far, this has been a Summer Between States, changing homes and jobs and just about everything in between. An awful lot of people have been awfully kind, offering helping hands and cars and spaces. It'll be a while yet before we're settled, but it feels like we're right on the cusp.  
  
Onward to statelessness!
