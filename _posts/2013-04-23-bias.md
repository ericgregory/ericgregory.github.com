From [Ezra Klein](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/23/this-is-why-you-should-buy-neil-irwins-new-book/):

> People talk a lot about media bias. Some say there's a bias towards liberals or conservatives. Others say it's towards 
> ostentatious even-handedness, or sensationalism. But one of the most dangerous media biases is simply the bias towards events, 
> sources and narratives that are easy for those of us in the media to cover.
