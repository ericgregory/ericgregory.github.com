Not an exhaustive reading list or a "Best of 2014," but something in the middle: a handful of books and stories, mostly published last year, that have stuck with me.

**Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer**  
Hypnotic, understated ecological science fiction. The entire Southern Reach trilogy is fantastic, but the first book's complex narrator and perfectly pitched voice make it a masterpiece, and the novel tells a satisfyingly complete story on its own.

**Syllabus by Lynda Barry**  
Lynda Barry's work is suffused with this sly wisdom and warmth that makes you feel more grounded and understanding for having read it. (I heard her speak in DC about a year ago, and she's the same way in person). Her latest book collects and expands on her beautifully illustrated syllabi for her art/writing classes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Worthwhile for anyone, but there's a ton to learn here if you're a teacher, artist, or writer.

**[How to Get Back to the Forest](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/how-to-get-back-to-the-forest/) by Sofia Samatar**  
Horror stories and sleepaway camp go hand-in-hand, but this is the only one I've read that has made camp genuinely unsettling. Incisive, eerie science fiction.

**We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler**  
Though nothing fundamentally speculative happens, this is science fiction in the truest sense: a novel about empathy and family-as-experiment and what it means for the people involved. Also beautiful and broad-hearted and easy to recommend to just about anyone.

**The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell**  
Feels like David Mitchell doing Stephen King, which is not a bad thing. A little sloppy in its fantasy worldbuilding, sometimes, but compulsively readable and moving in its depiction of a life in mosaic. And there's an elegaic realism to the dystopian coda that feels urgent even if you're a little tired of post-apocalypse: this just reads like a clear-eyed picture of how a world winds down.

**How to Be Happy by Eleanor Davis**  
A beautiful collection of comics about melancholy and contentment and family, including an incredible near-future short story, all gorgeously drawn.

**Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel**  
I feel like I halfway avoided the apocalypse in my reading last year, but it kept coming up in the books I really loved. Unexpected human connections and performing Shakespeare after the fall of the modern world. Thoughtful, hopeful, and humane.

**The Peripheral by William Gibson**  
The William Gibson novel I've been waiting for. You can't talk much about the premise without spoiling it, but: the voice is terse and quietly funny, the protagonist balances badass cool and complexity, and the setting is (partly) a tangible near-future Appalachia.

**Mothers, Lock Up Your Daughters Because They are Terrifying by Alice Sola Kim**  
A raw, creepy, funny, moving short story that feels like a novel, with an amazing voice and immediate characters and high school dark magic rooted in loneliness. Included in *Monstrous Affections*, an anthology with a just ridiculously great list of contributors.
