This is definitely a work-in-progress (and based on [an Old El Paso recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/easy-chilaquiles/)), so probably don't expect too much, but it balances laziness and tastiness well enough that it's becoming a pretty regular staple for me.

 + ~1.25 lbs chicken breast
 + 16 oz salsa verde
 + 1/2 cup sour cream (plus an extra spoonful)
 + a bunch of chips or taco shells (can be stale)
 + some cheese, mozzarella or pepper jack

Set oven to 350F. In a bowl, mix one and a half cups of the salsa verde with a half cup of sour cream, then set aside. Cut up and pan fry the chicken breast with salt, pepper, hot sauce, lemon zest, whatever else. Use cooking spray on cake pan or casserole dish, then cover bottom with crunched chips/taco shells. Scatter the chicken over the chips, then pour the salsa/sour cream mixture on top. Put some cheese on there. 

Now cover all of that with another layer of chips. Now take the remaining salsa verde, mix in bowl with just a spoonful of sour cream, and pour this over the second layer of chips. Add more cheese. Drizzle some tomato-based salsa on top if you'd like. Bake for thirty minutes.
