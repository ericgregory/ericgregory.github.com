title: "Garlic-headed buffalo chili"
category: blog
---
I've made this for years but never gotten around to measuring or writing down the ingredients. UNTIL NOW. Here's what I used last time -- it came out pretty well and made enough for two.
 
+ 1lb ground buffalo
+ 2 strips thick-cut bacon
+ 2 heads of garlic
+ 1/4 large sweet onion
+ 14.5 oz crushed tomato
+ ?? tomato paste (lost track)
+ 7 oz black beans
+ 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce
+ Salt, pepper, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper to taste
 
I roasted the garlic ([like this](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/roasted_garlic/)) and cooked both buffalo and bacon for a minute or two on stovetop. Put it all in the pot, mixed with diced onions and tomatoes and beans and a little tomato paste, let it simmer on low for an hour and a half or so. Then added seasoning and a little more tomato paste, let it go for another hourish. Usually I let it sit for longer; in the past, it's come out best when I've used a crockpot.
 
This isn't quite a final draft, and I'll probably come back and fiddle with it when I make the chili again. But in the meantime: buffalo and bacon and weapons-grade concentrations of garlic.
