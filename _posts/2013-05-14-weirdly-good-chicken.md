Nothing fancy here, but I'm forgetful. More a checklist than a recipe, but it's also my only meal in regular rotation that feels pretty fail-safe:

* Get a ~4lb whole chicken
* Put a lot of pepper and garlic powder on it, also some salt and lemon zest
* Cook on stovetop briefly, just until color starts to change
* Set the chicken on a cooking sheet, put a head of garlic inside, surround with maybe brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, chopped onions, and more garlic
* Cook at 375 for 1hr and 15mins
