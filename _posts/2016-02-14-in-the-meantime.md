Since last June:

+ Returned to teaching
+ Started and published the first issue of [a small press magazine](www.middle-planet.com)
+ Moved into and made significant renovations on a house
+ Got engaged to Julia

Busy eight months or so. At the moment:

+ Second semester
+ Readying the second issue of Middle Planet
+ Planning a wedding
+ Fiction?

We're a month past resolution season, so maybe I can take myself a bit more seriously when I say that I want to write here (and in general) more often. In the meantime, here's what I read last year:
