I've got a new story, "The March Wind," [coming out in LCRW 33](http://mossyskull.com/environmentalism/lcrw-33-contents/). Take a gander at this lovely cover by Kevin Huizenga:

Both the story and the magazine mean a lot to me -- LCRW published my very first piece of fiction exactly ten (!) years ago. And I'm excited to share pages with these folks:
