<p>
        I write about science fiction, technology, imaginary people, and happenings around my hometown of Carrboro, NC.
<p>
        My stories have appeared or are forthcoming in <i>Lightspeed</i>, <i>Strange Horizons</i>, <i>Shine: An Anthology of Optimistic SF</i> from Solaris Books, <i>Zombies: More Recent Undead</i> from Prime Books, and elsewhere. I earned my MFA from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I've written non-fiction for <i>The Internet Review of Science Fiction</i> and <i>Fantasy Magazine</i> and served as a guest editor for <i>Bull Spec</i>.
