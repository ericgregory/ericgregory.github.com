<p><strong><a href="http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-sympathy/">The Sympathy</a></strong> <br/>
<em>Lightspeed</em>, April 2012</p>

<blockquote><p>The apartment was in his name, and the Accord was in hers. It took Lauren less than a minute to step out one door and into
the other. She put her suitcase in the floorboard and her laptop bag in the passenger seat. Her container garden fit snugly
in the back.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-harrowers/">The Harrowers</a></strong> <br/>
<em>Lightspeed</em>, May 2011</p>

<blockquote><p>He wasn’t the roughneck sort who usually came around looking for a guide. Right age, maybe: Seventeen, eighteen. But the boy had a pressed, conservative look to him. Skinny, clean-shaven, all done up in slacks and suspenders and a white, sweaty shirt. I didn’t know what to make of him, and I didn’t like that I didn’t know.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://futurismic.com/2010/06/01/new-fiction-miguel-and-the-viatura-by-eric-gregory/">Miguel and the Viatura</a></strong> <br/>
<em>Futurismic</em>, June 2010</p>

<blockquote><p>Miguel knew so little about his brother’s life: it spun in a wild, elliptical orbit which now and then intersected with Miguel, tugged him onto brief, strange paths.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="">The Earth of Yunhe</a></strong> <br/>
<em>Shine: An Anthology of Optimistic Science Fiction</em> <br/>
Solaris Books, April 2010</p>

<blockquote><p>The jail was lit by a single yellow bulb. I strode down the hall of open doors to the lone locked cell at the end, and my shadow pitched across the walls like a drunk. There was a tripod stool outside of Xiaohao’s door; I rapped twice on the thick metal and sat down. After an uncertain moment of silence, I heard my brother stir on the other side.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2009/20090803/salt-f.shtml">Salt’s Father</a></strong> <br/>
<em>Strange Horizons</em>, August 2009</p>

<blockquote><p>As far as he could tell, the servitor was wild. That was rare, but not unheard of — now and then an electrical storm mixed up the things’ programming, left them running on instinct or wild AI or dead memories. Where it had come from was anyone’s guess. Perhaps the estate of a nearby technocrat, perhaps the Little City itself. The old man had briefly (very briefly) considered asking around in town—had anyone heard about a lost servitor? But he was afraid it might be put down or recycled. Besides, it suited him to have something strange to care for.</p></blockquote>
