         <span style="font-size: 80%; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 25px;">Wednesday, November 06, 2013</span>
        <p>I started Teju Cole&rsquo;s <em>Open City</em> today, and this passage from the first chapter was nicely synchronistic:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the other side of the grocery store was a Blockbuster; though I had never rented anything from there, I was startled to see a sign announcing it, too, was going out of business. If Blockbuster couldn&rsquo;t make it in an area full of students and families, it meant that the business model had been fatally damaged, that the desperate efforts they had made recently, and which I now recalled, of lowering rental prices, launching an advertising blitz, and abolishing late fines, had all come too late. I thought of Tower Records &mdash; a connection I couldn&rsquo;t help making, given that both companies had for a long time dominated their respective industries. It wasn&rsquo;t that I felt sorry for these faceless national corporations; far from it. They had made their profits and their names by destroying smaller, earlier local businesses. But I was touched not only at the swiftness and dispassion with which the market swallowed even the most resilient enterprises. Businesses that had seemed unshakable a few years previously disappeared in the span, seemingly, of a few weeks. Whatever role they played passed on to other hands, hands that would feel briefly invincible and would, in their turn, be defeated by unforeseen changes. These survivors would also come to be forgotten.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Running reminders on some super-basic Git commands. (Also: GitHub and Code School have a fun fifteen-minute <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">primer</a>.)</p>

<p><code>git init</code>: builds .git directory containing metadata and history<br/>
<code>git add</code>: stages a file for commit; can stage folders, filetype wildcards (ex. &#42;.txt)</span></p>

<p><code>git add .</code><br/>
<code>git commit -m &ldquo;Stages all indexed additions or modifications&rdquo;</code><br/>
<code>git push</code></p>

<p><code>git add . -A</code><br/>
<code>git commit -m &ldquo;Stages all indexed changes, including file deletions&rdquo;</code><br/>
<code>git push</code></p>

<p><code>git checkout</code>: move to branch<br/>
<code>git branch -a</code>: list branches<br/>
<code>git pull</code>: pull changes from remote</p>

        <p>Stuart Feinstein on <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/2/uncertainty/certainly-not">science and uncertainty</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Questions&hellip;go places, take you down new avenues, generate curiosity and inspiration. They are the critical ingredients to new experiments. Of course, answers are important, but too often they are treated as an end. Think about the word “conclusion.” It is an answer drawn from data, but it can denote the end of the process, of the story, of the adventure. It is at once a determination and a termination. We may hear about the conclusive results in this or that study, or the conclusions to be drawn from this work, but the last thing a scientist wants is a conclusion in the sense of, “there ain’t no more to do.” For all the talk about drawing conclusions in scientific studies, there is relatively little in science that is conclusive.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite thing about science (and science fiction). You don&rsquo;t expect an answer to everything, or you probably shouldn&rsquo;t. Instead, you&rsquo;ve got a workable way to live with provisionality. From that angle, science fiction has at its heart something sad and hopeful and warm and wry: stories about people running up against the edges of their answers and trying to live with endless questions.</p>
