<span style="font-family: 'Raleway'; font-size: 24pt;"><strong>About</strong></span>
  
I write about science fiction, technology, and happenings around my home of Carrboro, North Carolina.

My stories have appeared or are forthcoming in <i>[Lightspeed](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com)</i>, <i>[Strange Horizons](http://www.strangehorizons.com)</i>, <i>Shine: An Anthology of Optimistic SF</i> from Solaris Books, <i>Zombies: More Recent Undead</i> from Prime Books, and elsewhere. I earned my MFA from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, and I've edited fiction for publications like <i>[Bull Spec](http://www.bullspec.com)</i> and <i>[Pinball](http://www.thisispinball.com)</i>.

I nabbed the title of the site from St. Vincent's [The Neighbors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2S2tQF6SQU):

> Tomorrow's some kind of strangerland / where all the news is good.
