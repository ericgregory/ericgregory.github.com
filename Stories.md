Lightspeed, April 2012

> The apartment was in his name, and the Accord was in hers. It took Lauren less than a minute to step out one door and into 
> the other. She put her suitcase in the floorboard and her laptop bag in the passenger seat. Her container garden fit snugly
> in the back.  

[The Harrowers](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-harrowers/)  
Lightspeed, May 2011

> Christ, I thought. And then: Of course—P.K.: Preacher’s Kid. Should’ve caught that earlier. I finished off the Yanjing, then 
> opened the cooler and unscrewed a jar of whiskey. I’d heard of harrowers before, but never met one alive.

> Miguel knew so little about his brother’s life: it spun in a wild, elliptical orbit which now and then intersected with Miguel, tugged him onto brief, strange paths.

Solaris Books, April 2010

>The jail was lit by a single yellow bulb. I strode down the hall of open doors to the lone locked cell at the end, and my shadow pitched across the walls like a drunk. There was a tripod stool outside of Xiaohao’s door; I rapped twice on the thick metal and sat down. After an uncertain moment of silence, I heard my brother stir on the other side. He shuffled around for another minute, grunting quietly, then peered at last through his small barred window. He wasn’t fat, but his face had filled out during his years with the Ecclesia. His left eye was red, encircled by an ugly bruise that had only gotten uglier since the last time I visited him.

Strange Horizons, August 2009

>As far as he could tell, the servitor was wild. That was rare, but not unheard of — now and then an electrical storm mixed up the things’ programming, left them running on instinct or wild AI or dead memories. Where it had come from was anyone’s guess. Perhaps the estate of a nearby technocrat, perhaps the Little City itself. The old man had briefly (very briefly) considered asking around in town—had anyone heard about a lost servitor? But he was afraid it might be put down or recycled. Besides, it suited him to have something strange to care for.

Interzone 223, July 2009

>Every summer, Ganesha Colony invited a major scholar to spend a month on their outrageously monied premises, six jumps from Earth on a planet that only the wealthy could love. There were lectures and workshops, reading groups and research, and at the end of the month there was a twist. This year, Simon Trung was the major scholar. I was the twist.

[Blood God Blood]()  
Black Static 7, October 2008

>When first she met him, she heard his music—a low gospel that followed him like a light-loving moth. Or not gospel, exactly, not good news, but quiet holy blues, a little hymn to loneliness.
